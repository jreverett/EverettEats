		"ingredients": [
			"225g (1 cup) unsalted butter",
			"2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
			"300g (1 1/2 cups) granulated sugar",
			"2 whole eggs + 1 egg yolk, room temperature",
			"1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
			"65g (3/4 cup) unsweetened cocoa powder",
			"63g (3/4 cup) all-purpose flour",
			"1/4 teaspoon salt",
			"130g (3/4 cup) chocolate, chopped (or chips)"
		],
		"instructions": [
			"Prep: Preheat oven to 175Â°C. Line 8x8 pan with baking paper, leaving overhang for easy removal.",
			"Melt: Microwave butter in 30-second intervals until melted. Immediately stir in oil and sugar. Let cool 5 minutes.",
			"Mix Wet: Beat in 2 eggs + 1 yolk one at a time, then vanilla. Mix until just combined.",
			"Add Dry: Sift cocoa powder, flour, and salt directly over wet ingredients. Fold gently until just combined - DO NOT OVERMIX. Fold in 3/4 of the chopped chocolate.",
			"Optional but recommended: Refrigerate batter 15 minutes for extra fudgy texture.",
			"Bake: Pour into pan and evenly distribute the remaining 1/4 of chopped chocolate on top. Bake 25-30 minutes. The top should be set but still glossy. A toothpick should come out with moist crumbs, not clean.",
			"Cool: Let cool in pan 30 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting for best results."

		"tips": [
			"Don't Overmix: For extra fudgy brownies, don't overmix the batter once you add the flour",
			"Perfect Doneness: The slight sinking in the middle is normal and indicates fudgy texture",
			"Clean Cuts: Use a sharp knife and clean between cuts for neat squares",
			"Storage: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days",
			"Moisture Tip: Add a piece of bread to the container to maintain moisture if they start to dry out",
			"Quick Cooling: Freezer method - Cool for 20 mins at room temp, then 20 mins in the freezer if you're in a hurry"
