			"Optional but recommended: Refrigerate batter 15 minutes for extra fudgy texture.",

		"Use a slow cooker liner bag for foolproof waterproofing in the water bath, or skip the water bath entirely and place a pan of water on the bottom oven rack instead.",
		"The centre should wobble like jelly when done - it continues to set as it cools. Don't overbake.",
		"Choose passion fruits that feel heavy and have wrinkled, dimpled skin - these are ripest and most flavourful.",
		"Blueberry variation: If you can't find passion fruit, use 200g raspberries + 200g blueberries instead. Add 3-4 tbsp lemon juice to replace the passion fruit's tartness, and reduce sugar to 60-70g.",
		"This cheesecake tastes even better the next day as flavours develop. Keeps well in the fridge for 3-5 days when covered.",

			"Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches a full rolling boil. Reduce heat slightly and cook for 2 full minutes, stirring constantly. The mixture should be very thick.",
			"Remove from heat. Whisk 4 egg yolks in a bowl. Slowly add 4-5 tablespoons hot mixture to yolks, whisking constantly to temper. Pour warmed yolks back into saucepan.",

			"Make the meringue: Preheat oven to 160°C fan. In a clean, grease-free bowl, whisk 4 egg whites and ½ teaspoon lemon juice until soft peaks form. Add 100g sugar one tablespoon at a time, whisking well after each addition. Whisk in ½ teaspoon vanilla until stiff, glossy peaks form.",
			"Immediately spread meringue over hot lemon filling, ensuring it touches the pastry edge all around to seal. Create peaks and swirls with the back of a spoon.",

			"Zest your lemons, pressing firmly to get the oil-rich yellow part. Gently fold in remaining flour and lemon zest using a metal spoon or silicone spatula - don't overmix. Add milk to reach dropping consistency (batter falls slowly off spoon).",
			"Pour batter into lined loaf tin and level the surface. Place in middle of oven and bake for 45-50 minutes without opening the door for first 40 minutes. Test with skewer in multiple spots - it should come out clean.",
